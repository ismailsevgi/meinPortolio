            Hi, I am Ismail, I live in Turkey and I am 27 years old. My
            front-end developer career began almost one year ago. In fact, I got
            a graduate of education faculty from Sıtkı Kocman University which
            is a prestigious university of our country.
          </p>

            I think I am highly talented in React and UI design. However there
            is much more things to learn for me. While I am coding, I pay
            attention Clean Code Principles and creating reusable modules.In my
            opinion programming is like an ocean and I am just little fish, so
            there are many places I could discover. Bye 👋,
          </p>
